#+TITLE: About Me

I'm Felix, a student in Washington D.C. planning to major in computer science and/or astrophysics. Though history is not a passion of mine, I find the world wars and their politics truly fascinating to study and learn from. I chose to look at the States' entry into WWI for this exhibit as I feel education on the world wars in the public school system is lacking, and because I believe WWI fundamentally changed the United States. Studying this topic allowed me to better understand the United States, as well as the current global political situation.
